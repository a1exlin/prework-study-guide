## Description


- My motivation is to strive for creating professional web development that will help and provide others that are in need of service. 

- The purpose of this project is to learn and establish a strong foundation of what it takes to become a professional web developer. Methods such as Git Flow, and Version Control are critical in Web Devleopment.
